## N-gram reconstruction project for the Cline Center 
(Kefu Zhu, Andrew Mehrmann)

### Advisor: Professor Robert J. Brunner

#### Project description
The Cline Center in University of Illinois Research Park uses data science to predict when and where social conflicts will happen by gathering news articles around the world and analyze them. However, some of articles are protected under copyright law. So the Cline Center can only distribute their metadata such as n-grams. The purpose of this project is to determine what is the highest possible value for n in n-grams under the condition that people cannot reconstruct the orignical document based on the n-grams data(so we won't violate the copyright).

#### To do list

1. Grab n-gram data from documents

2. Train regression model based on the n-gram data to reconstruct original document

3. Test the hypothesis that the value of n for n-gram is allowed to increase when the length of original document increases.

4. For what value of n can we reconstruct documents of a given length?

#### Used tools

* Python
* NLTK
* Scikit-learn
