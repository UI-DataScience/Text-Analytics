# Text-Analytics

Welcome to [UI Data Science](http://ui-datascience.github.io/) - Text Analytics! We conduct research through the University of Illinois on a variety of Text Analytics topics including:

* Reconstructing Documents from their n-grams
* Document classification
* Document geocoding
* Automated ontology development

Currently, we are surveying methods of obtaining and working with text data in the Python programming language. We make heavy use of [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) both for obtaining and analyzing texts and we are exploring alternative sources of free text data including [HathiTrust](https://www.hathitrust.org/) and [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

We use the [Wiki](https://github.com/UI-DataScience/Text-Analytics/wiki) for more detailed descriptions of our projects (when we can be so descriptive) and the [Resources](https://github.com/UI-DataScience/Text-Analytics/tree/master/Resources) directory for housing instructional materials we use to get students started with text analytics.
